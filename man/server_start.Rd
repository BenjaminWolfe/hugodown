page?}

\description{
\code{server_start()} starts a hugo server that will automatically re-generate
the site whenever the input changes. You only need to execute this once
per session; it continues to run in the background as you work on the site.

\code{server_stop()} kills the server. This happens automatically when you exit
R so you shouldn't normally need to run this.

\code{server_browse()} opens the site in the RStudio viewer or your web browser.
}
