<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of hugodown is to make it easy to use RMarkdown within a [hugo](http://gohugo.io/) website. It's similar to [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), but is focussed purely on hugo websites, and enforces a stricter partitioning of roles: hugodown is responsible for transforming `.Rmd` to `.md`, and is hugo responsible for transforming `.md` to `.html`.

The key to using hugodown is to put `output: hugodown::hugo_document()` in the YAML metadata of your `.Rmd` files. Then knitting the file will generate a `.md` file designed to work well with hugo. The rest of hugodown just makes your life a little easier:

* `server_start()` will automatically start a hugo server in the background,
  automatically preivewing your site as you update it.

* `post_create()` will creates a new post (filling in default content from
  the hugo [archetype](https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/)).

## Installation

hugodown isn't available from CRAN yet, but you can install the development version from GitHub with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("r-lib/hugodown")
```

## Configuration

We recommend using a `config.yaml` (rather than `config.toml` or `config.json`). You must use the goldmark markdown renderer, and we recommend ignoring knitr intermediates:

```yaml
ignoreFiles: ['\.Rmd$', '_files$', '_cache$', '\.knit\.md$', '\.utf8\.md$']

markup:
  defaultMarkdownHandler: goldmark
  goldmark:
    renderer:
      unsafe: true
  highlight:
    style: pygments
```

To use html widgets, you must **TODO**.
